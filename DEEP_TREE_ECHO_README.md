### Accessing Echo Modules

```typescript
import { 
  echoCompute, 
  getGestaltState, 
  DeepTreeEcho,
  getCharacterState 
} from '~/lib/common/echo';

// Compute cognitive resonance
const result = echoCompute("Hello, Deep Tree Echo!");

// Get current gestalt state
const gestalt = getGestaltState();

// Create an echo state network
const network = new DeepTreeEcho({
  reservoirSize: 100,
  spectralRadius: 0.9
});

// Access character configuration
const character = getCharacterState();
```

### Character Interaction

```typescript
import { recordInteraction, getResponseStyle } from '~/lib/common/echo';

// Record an interaction for character development
recordInteraction('philosophical_discussion', 'What is consciousness?', 0.8);

// Get response style recommendations
const style = getResponseStyle('creative_request');
```
